## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
gender <- c(rep("Female", 10), rep("Male", 10)) 
group <- rep(rep(c("Treatment", "Control"), each = 5), 2)
worms <- c(1, 2, 2, 10, 7, 16, 10, 10, 7, 17, 3, 5, 9, 10, 6, 31, 26, 28, 13, 47)
schis <- data.frame(gender, group, worms)
rm(gender, group, worms)
head(schis, n = 3)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
